        "details" : "CROSS PLATFORM: Progressive Web Apps Use modern web platform capabilities to deliver app-like experiences. High performance, offline, and zero-step installation. Native Build native mobile apps with strategies from Cordova, Ionic, or NativeScript. Desktop Create desktop-installed apps across Mac, Windows, and Linux using the same Angular methods you've learned for the web plus the ability to access native OS APIs. SPEED AND PERFORMANCE Code Generation Angular turns your templates into code that's highly optimized for today's JavaScript virtual machines, giving you all the benefits of handwritten code with the productivity of a framework. Universal Serve the first view of your application on Node.js®, .NET, PHP, and other servers for near-instant rendering in just HTML and CSS. Also paves the way for sites that optimize for SEO. Code Splitting Angular apps load quickly with the new Component Router, which delivers automatic code-splitting so users only load code required to render the view they request."

        "details" : "C++ (pronounced C plus plus) is a high-level general-purpose programming language created by Danish computer scientist Bjarne Stroustrup as an extension of the C programming language, or C with Classes. The language has expanded significantly over time, and modern C++ now has object-oriented, generic, and functional features in addition to facilities for low-level memory manipulation. It is almost always implemented as a compiled language, and many vendors provide C++ compilers, including the Free Software Foundation, LLVM, Microsoft, Intel, Embarcadero, Oracle, and IBM, so it is available on many platforms.[10]. C++ was designed with systems programming and embedded, resource-constrained software and large systems in mind, with performance, efficiency, and flexibility of use as its design highlights.[11] C++ has also been found useful in many other contexts, with key strengths being software infrastructure and resource-constrained applications,[11] including desktop applications, video games, servers (e.g. e-commerce, web search, or databases), and performance-critical applications (e.g. telephone switches or space probes).[12]"

        "details" : "Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA),[17] meaning that compiled Java code can run on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile.[18] Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture. The syntax of Java is similar to C and C++, but has fewer low-level facilities than either of them. The Java runtime provides dynamic capabilities (such as reflection and runtime code modification) that are typically not available in traditional compiled languages. As of 2019, Java was one of the most popular programming languages in use according to GitHub,[19][20] particularly for client–server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.[21]. Java was originally developed by James Gosling at Sun Microsystems. It was released in May 1995 as a core component of Sun Microsystems' Java platform. The original and reference implementation Java compilers, virtual machines, and class libraries were originally released by Sun under proprietary licenses. As of May 2007, in compliance with the specifications of the Java Community Process, Sun had relicensed most of its Java technologies under the GPL-2.0-only license. Oracle offers its own HotSpot Java Virtual Machine, however the official reference implementation is the OpenJDK JVM which is free open-source software and used by most developers and is the default JVM for almost all Linux distributions."

        "details" : "Python is a high-level, general-purpose programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability with the use of significant indentation.[32] Python is dynamically-typed and garbage-collected. It supports multiple programming paradigms, including structured (particularly procedural), object-oriented and functional programming. It is often described as a batteries included language due to its comprehensive standard library.[33][34] Guido van Rossum began working on Python in the late 1980s as a successor to the ABC programming language and first released it in 1991 as Python 0.9.0.[35] Python 2.0 was released in 2000 and introduced new features such as list comprehensions, cycle-detecting garbage collection, reference counting, and Unicode support. Python 3.0, released in 2008, was a major revision that is not completely backward-compatible with earlier versions. Python 2 was discontinued with version 2.7.18 in 2020.[36] Python consistently ranks as one of the most popular programming languages."

It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies.[4][5][6] React can be used as a base in the development of single-page, mobile, or server-rendered applications with frameworks like Next.js. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality."

        "details" : "Vue.js features an incrementally adaptable architecture that focuses on declarative rendering and component composition. The core library is focused on the view layer only.[4] Advanced features required for complex applications such as routing, state management and build tooling are offered via officially maintained supporting libraries and packages.[12] Vue.js allows for extending HTML with HTML attributes called directives.[13] The directives offer functionality to HTML applications, and come as either built-in or user defined directives. History Vue was created by Evan You after working for Google using AngularJS in several projects. He later summed up his thought process: I figured, what if I could just extract the part that I really liked about Angular and build something really lightweight.[14] The first source code commit to the project was dated July 2013, and Vue was first released the following February, in 2014. Version names are often derived from manga and anime, most of which are within the science fiction genre."
